Startup/Shutdown instructions for Tank V 0.000001 AT THE CLEARBLADE OFFICE ONLY

-------
Startup
-------

This assumes the two batteries and the beaglebone (bb) are in the tank.

Inspect wires -- especially on the voltage regulator!

Plug in both batteries -- one that goes to the voltage regulator (breadboard) and
the one that goes to the Motor Controller's (mc) power port. The mc sits on top of the bb.

Now, power up the bb by pluging the barrel jack coming off of the breadboard into the
5V port of the bb.

Wait.

Wait. (booting the bb and getting wifi set up takes a while)

Now, from your laptop, make sure you are connected to the wifi network "ClearBlade" -- NOT "ClearBlade_5G"

The ip address of the bb (at ClearBlade) should be 192.168.0.70. from a terminal on your laptop, run:
    ssh -l root 192.168.0.70 (you won't need a password)

if the above hangs for a long time, interrupt the command and try again. Eventually you should get in.
if you don't, go to the steps outlined below under "If the bb does not get connected to wifi on startup". When that is successful, continue from here...

When you are logged in, do NOT cd anywhere -- you are in the right directory.

run
    ./cbdemo

This is the go program that drives the tank. You should see some output about ids, a message published,
and then a message saying you are going into a select() statement. ERIC -- this is where the debug info
is scrolled across the screen when the tank is running.

At this point, the tank is ready to go.

Get the ipad and open the "ClearBlade Demo" app. It's on the bottom of the second screen.

The app should start and eventually (at the top of the screen) it should say that it is paired to a tank.

Play with the tank. The screen that has the dual tread controls works best.

See Charlie for instructions on how to run the dashboard.

Have fun. Don't wreck the tank or screw up any of the cords/wires.

--------
Shutdown
--------

From your ssh connection (on your laptop) to the bb, do the following:
    
    interrupt <Ctrl-C> the cbdemo app. It will send a message or two to the cb platform and shutdown.
    run "halt; exit". This will start the bb shutdown process and get you out of the shell.

Now, go over to the bb on the tank and wait for the lights on the bb to go out. Sometimes this takes
a while. NOTE: The light on the mc will still be on -- don't worry about that.

Now, unplug the barrel power connector from the 5V bb jack.

Disconnect (and charge) both batteries. Don't take them out of the tank. Put the tank next to the
battery chargers.

shutdown and power off the ipad.

Go do something more productive.

----------------------------------------------------
If the bb does not get connected to wifi on startup:
----------------------------------------------------

DO NOT shut off the bb or unplug it -- leave it on.

put the tank/bb next to your laptop.

plug in the USB to micro-USB cable from your laptop to the bb

run the following command from a terminal:

ssh -l root 192.168.7.2 (or ssh root@192.168.7.2)

You are now connected to the bb through the usb. Do not cd anywhere.

run the following:

    ifdown wlan0 (ignore the output)
    ifup wlan0

This is trying to reinitialize wifi. The ifup command may take a while. Eventually it should say
something about being bound/connected (or something) to the ip addr 192.168.0.70

Once that succeeds, from another shell, run
    ssh -l root 192.168.0.70

This should succeed. If it doesn't, go have a beer.

Once you're in on the .70 shell, type "exit" from the OTHER Shell -- the .7.2 one. Leave the .70 ssh
connection open.

unplug the usb connection from the bb.

Continue above where you left off. You're almost there!
